## TODO
[ ] frontend code must get the problem from the server instead of static configuration
[ ] scoreboard must only allow improvements per username
[ ] frontend to get a status box instead of three leds. Remember to account that only one submission can be active at a time.
[ ] more accurate timing: a good algorithm was able to get 0 microseconds :3
[ ] probably tons more
